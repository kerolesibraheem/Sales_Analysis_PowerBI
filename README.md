# Sales_Analysis_PowerBI
This project presents sales data for a retail company, visualized using Power BI to analyze performance across products, regions, customers, and order priorities from 2009 to 2012.

I explored sales and profit trends, identified top-performing regions and product categories, analyzed shipping costs and durations, and segmented customer behavior to uncover key business drivers.

The goal was to provide actionable insights for stakeholders to optimize sales strategies, improve regional performance, streamline shipping operations, and enhance customer segmentation and targeting.
