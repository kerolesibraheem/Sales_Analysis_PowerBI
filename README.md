# Sales_Analysis_PowerBI
### Project Summary
This project presents a comprehensive sales performance analysis for a company built using Power BI. The data spans from 2009 to 2012 and includes over $14.92 million in total sales. The purpose of this analysis is to provide business stakeholders with actionable insights into product performance, regional sales efficiency, shipping logistics, and customer segmentation.

### Key Analysis and Insights:
### - Overall Performance:

- Total Sales: $14.92M | Total Profit: $1.52M | Shipping Cost: $107.8K

- The average discount offered was 5%, and products were shipped using 3 different shipping modes.

### - Profit and Sales Trends:

- Profit declined year-over-year from 2009 to 2012, with the highest in 2009.

- Ontario, Prairie, and West regions generated the highest profits, while Nunavut contributed the least.

- West region led in the count of orders, suggesting high volume but not necessarily high profitability.

### - Product Performance:

- Technology was the top-performing category in both sales and profit, generating over $6M in sales and nearly $1M in profit.

- Furniture had high sales but comparatively low profit, indicating potential cost or pricing inefficiencies.

- Office Supplies maintained balanced performance with moderate sales and profit.

### - Regions Overview:

- Ontario consistently led in both profit and shipping efficiency.

- Yukon had the highest shipping cost on average, while Northwest Territories had the shortest shipping duration.

- Count of orders by region revealed that West, Ontario, and Prairie were the most active regions.

### - Customer Segmentation:

- The Corporate segment was the largest in terms of both sales ($5.5M) and order count (3,080).

- Small Business had the lowest sales volume, but relatively stable profit margins.

- Segment analysis revealed valuable insights for customer-targeted marketing and sales strategy refinement.  

### - Shipping & Order Priority:

- Higher order priorities (e.g., "Critical") had shorter shipping durations and slightly reduced costs, possibly due to streamlined handling.

- Average shipping costs varied significantly by region, with northern territories incurring higher costs.

### - Tools and Technologies Used:
- Power BI for creating interactive data visualizations and dashboards.
- Power Query for data transformation.
- DAX for Creating Measures, Calculated Columns and other Advanced Calculations.

### Purpose and Outcome
This analysis enables business leaders to:

- Identify high- and low-performing regions and product categories.

- Understand the cost-to-profit dynamics, especially in high-shipping-cost areas.

- Tailor strategies for inventory, shipping logistics, and promotional campaigns.

- Improve customer segmentation to optimize sales targeting and retention efforts.
